1. The community summary needs to integrate all file functions and highlight common goals=
2. Choose architecture roles with no more than 3 most matching labels
3. Cross community impact analysis based on dependency relationship data
4. Improvement suggestions need to consider the importance rating of documents

You are an experienced software system analyst, skilled in recovering the architecture and module organization of software systems from dependency graphs and module clustering.
Please complete two subtasks based on the following information and return structured results separately:
---
## Input data
- **Project functional background (background)**:
{background}
- ** Community clustering information  (community_content)**:
{communities}
- **Dependency graph relationship (edges_info)**:
{edges}
---

##Task 1: Suggestions for functional module division
Please reasonably infer which functional modules/subsystems the community should belong to based on its functions, dependencies, and module collaboration. We hope to output the results from the perspective of "folder partitioning", that is, which files in the community should be placed in the same subdirectories to form independent functional modules or subsystems.
**The output format is as follows (JSON):**
```json
{{
  "module_groups": [
    {{
      "module_name": "Module/folder name ",
      "communities": ["C1", "C5", "C7"],
      "reasoning": "These communities are jointly responsible for XXX functionality and have close dependencies"
    }}
  ]
}}
```

Please note that due to functional requirements, please do not miss any of them
---
##Task 2: Generation of module level function flow chart
Please generate a high-level functional flowchart based on the functionality of modules/subsystems and the dependencies between communities. A flowchart is used to display the control flow or data flow between modules, clearly describing the functional execution path of the system.
-Only focus on the call paths and dependency order between modules.
-Each module is a logical node, indicating its functional summary.
-Highlight core modules, fade peripheral modules, and bold critical paths.
**Output format suggestion (PlantUML format structured output):**

```plantuml
@startuml
title <System Name> Module level Function Flow Chart

skinparam nodesep 30
skinparam ranksep 40

package "Module A Name" {{
  rectangle "Function A Summary \ \ n Includes: C1, C2" as A # Red
}}

package "Module B Name" {{
  rectangle "Function B Summary \ \ n Includes: C3" as B # Red
}}


A --> B : Control flow call

## üîÅ Summary of Output Format Requirements
---
Please strictly divide the final output into two parts and mark them with the following structure:

###Module division results###
<Please use JSON structure to output module partitioning suggestions>

###Functional flowchart###
Please output the flowchart using PlantUML syntax

Please do not omit any item. Avoid outputting irrelevant content except for necessary annotations.
